- "The starter code provided includes the code for printing the menu for the customer, which was part of one of your Day 3 activities. You will be adapting this menu to allow customers to place an order, which includes storing the customer's order and printing the receipt with the total price of all items ordered. The starter code includes comments, which you may use as a guide for the steps you need to add."
## Code Considerations
- Lines 192-201 were assisted by a learning assistant. The code wasn't given to me directly, but influenced the way I wrote my code.
- A learning assistant noticed an issue with my print function on 209. I was referencing the wrong variable in the place of "item_space_string"
- A learning assistant identified that I wasn't converting price and quantity to strings before evaluating the length on lines 200 and 201
