## Code Considerations
- Lines 192-201 were assisted by a learning assistant. The code wasn't given to me directly, but influenced the way I wrote my code.
- A learning assistant noticed an issue with my print function on 209. I was referencing the wrong variable in the place of "item_space_string"
- A learning assistant identified that I wasn't converting price and quantity to strings before evaluating the length on lines 200 and 201
